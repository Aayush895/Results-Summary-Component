## My process

### Built with

The component was built with the help of following tools:
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While I was working on this project I learned about the basics of `css grids` and how to use it to make a basic component layout like this one. I also learned about `media queries` and how to use it, to make my designs compatible with different devices like mobile phones and tablets. But since this was a relatively friendly project I was able to complete it with relative ease.
